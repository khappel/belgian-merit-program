			<h3>
				Participating Shows
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Each state is allowed one State show and two regional shows to represent them in the Belgian Alliance – Hitch Program. In the event that the state does not have a state fair that represents the Belgian draft horse than a show can be chosen by the Belgian Draft Horse Alliance Board of Directors to represent the breed for that state.
				</li>
				<li>
					If there are multiple shows in the state that have well-attended Belgian draft horse shows, these shows may complete a Belgian Alliance Hitch Program application to be presented to the Belgian Draft Horse Alliance prior to December 1st (Extended to March 1st, 2024 due to launch of program, review applicants in Spring Meeting) to be accepted as a regional show into the Belgian Alliance Hitch Program the following year. The show must meet the following criteria:
					<li>
						Must maintain an index level of 3 for 2 years out of 3 years. If you do not achieve this, the Hitch Program show status will be pulled until the show can provide a revised plan and show success at maintaining the requirement.
