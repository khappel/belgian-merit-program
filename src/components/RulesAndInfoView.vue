            <h3>Open to all registered Belgian draft horses.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>

                    weanling
                    points and standings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no entry fee or sign up necessary to participate.
                    Canadian breeders, owners, and horses will be recognized in the same manner as American breeders,
                    owners, and
                    horses.

                <li>
                    It will be the responsibility of the owner or exhibitor to monitor their animal’s points through the
                    show season

            <h3>Participating Shows</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each state is allowed one State show and two Regional shows to represent them in the Belgian Merit
                    Program®. In
                    the
                    event that the state does not have a state fair that represents the Belgian draft horse then a show can
                    be
                    chosen by
                    the Belgian Draft Horse Alliance Board of Directors to represent the breed for that state.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If there are multiple shows in the state that have well-attended Belgian draft horse shows, these shows
                    may
                    complete
                    a Belgian Merit Program application to be presented to the Belgian Draft Horse Alliance prior to
                    December 1st to
                    be
                    accepted as a regional show into the Belgian Merit Program the following year. The show must meet the
                    following
                    criteria:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Must maintain an index level of 3 for 2 years out of 3 years. If you do not achieve this, the
                            Merit show
                            status
                            will
                            be pulled until the show can provide a revised plan and show success at maintaining the
                            requirement.
                        </li>

                            *Barring unforeseen circumstances, it is the discretion of the Belgian Alliance to determine if
                            the two

                <li>
                    The participating shows must have classes to match those of the Belgian Merit Program for points to be
                    awarded.
                    Example: Stallion classes of 3 and over would be accepted but stallion classes of 2 and over would not
                    be
                    accepted.
                    Mare classes of 4 and over would be accepted along with mare classes of 5 and over, but mare classes of
                    3 and
                    over
                    would not be accepted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Classes must be registered. Classes allowing non-registered horses will not be counted. Classes can be
                    combined
                    breed classes as long as the show indicates the horses that were Belgians.
                    Amendment: All mare and Stallion Classes must be registered. Gelding classes can be Open to
                    non-registered, but
                    the
                    registered horses will only count toward Merit points and Merit Status.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The champions will get the following awarding of raw points:

                        <li>Reserve grand champion animal gets 3 additional points</li>
                        <li>These overall raw points will then be multiplied by the index of the show to give the animal the
                            total
                            points
                            earned
                            at that show.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Index multipliers are determined by the number of registered animals shown in the halter classes (not
                    the number
                    entered) at that show that year. The index of the show will not be known until the completion of the
                    show.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The index is determined as follows:</li>
                        <li>Index of 9 if > 200 registered head shown</li>
                        <li>Index of 8 if 176 to 200 registered head shown</li>

                <li>
                    The following two cart classes will be recognized:
                    Registered Gelding Cart
                    Registered Mare Cart
                    Either class can be driven by a man or woman
                    No woman to drive or men to drive cart classes will be recognized.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Classes can be combined breed classes as long as the show indicates the horses that were Belgians.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These overall raw points will then be multiplied by the index of the show to give the animal the total
                    points earned
                    at that show.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Index multipliers are determined by the number of registered animals shown in the cart classes (not the
                    number entered) at that show that year. The index of the show will not be known until the completion of the
                    show.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The index is determined as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Index of 7 if 31 to 35 registered head shown</li>

                        <li>Index of 1 if 1 to 5 registered head shown</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Versatility Points awarded</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To qualify for the versatility points, the horse must compete in both its respected registered halter
                    class
                    and registered cart class at any approved Belgian Merit Show.</li>
                <li>Points will be tabulated by adding the total amount of halter points and cart points awarded at the
                    Belgian
                    Merit Show.
                    For Example: a horse received 30 points for halter (index multiplier included) and 15 points for cart
                    class
                    (index
                    multiplier included). The total amount of versatility points awarded is 45 points.
                    Champion points will be included in the overall raw score for the halter portion.</li>
                <li>If a horse does not place top 5 in either halter or cart, but participated in both classes. The horse
                    still
                    qualifies for the versatility program.
                    For Example: If a horse places top 5 in the halter portion but does not place top 5 in the cart portion-
                    the
                    horse’s halter points will still go towards the versatility points.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Show Season</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The show season will run from January 1st to November 25th of each year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As soon as the points are received by the Belgian Draft Horse Alliance and tallied, they will be posted
                    on the Corporation’s website for viewing. No additions or changes will be accepted after the Friday
                    following
                    NAILE.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is the responsibility of the owner or exhibitor to proof their animal’s points as they go through the
                    show season
                    and address any concerns or questions to the Alliance immediately. Results furnished with “entry” rather
                    than the
                    name of the animal will not be listed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Exhibitors will be responsible for reporting the horses used in the Registered Mare and Gelding Cart
                    classes if the information is not received from the show staff. All names must be reported by the Monday
